                            As a user, I want the navigation between pages to be more intuitive so that I can see all necessary information.

                            As a user, I want the option to select available classes as I type in a class name so that I can easily multi-select classes through their names.

                        <li>
                            As a user, I want the windows on the registration page to display the most relevant information more prominently so that I can register for my classes easier.

                        <li>
                            As a user, I want Athena to assist me in generating schedules so that the time taken to create a schedule is cut down.
                        </li>

                            As a user, I want Athena to assist me in generating schedules so that the time taken to create a schedule is cut down.
                            <p>
                                Justification: This user story is a key component of our proposed solution. It would change the functionality of Athena as a whole in order to improve the registration process. Our aim is to make Athena more effective for the user, and having a system in place that does most of the scheduling work for the student would greatly simplify the stress of planning. According to a study conducted by the Journal of Educational Psychology, students who felt that they were in control of their schedule and time reported higher evaluations of personal performance and “greater work and life satisfaction”. 
                                <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1991-13852-001">(8)</a>
                                Instead of the student having to think through and compare each individual combination of professors, times, and classes, the system could do all of this in a matter of seconds.

                            As a user, I want the option to select available classes as I type in a class name so that I can easily multi-select classes through their names. 
                            <p>
                                Justification: For this user story we took inspiration from third party websites like CourseOff, which aid students in planning their schedules. Changing the user interface of Athena could be one way of improving how Athena functions. Being able to have a list of all the classes you might want to take, and being able to select which ones are displayed on the calendar, is an example of one aspect of a good interface. An early example of software like Courseoff was developed at Saint Peter’s College many years ago. The intention of this software was to take stress off of the students and advisors so that the registration process for classes could go more smoothly.
                                <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=3d74113f057e2584e2eb579e6a0b776bc3bfc8fd">(5)</a> The software could determine if classes overlapped time, determine possible courses students could take, and allow students and advisors to see different sections of classes. <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=3d74113f057e2584e2eb579e6a0b776bc3bfc8fd">(5)</a> Courseoff is a modern version of this archaic example that students can use to help plan schedules, and could be more useful if the University of Georgia were to implement it into its current registration page.

                            As a user, I want the windows on the registration page to display the most relevant information more prominently so that I can register for my classes easier.
                            <p>
                                Justification: All the existing information necessary to make registration decisions is available to the student, but this information is not always easily accessible. When it comes to website design, websites like Athena should be designed using “straight usability,” or usability where the content of a website is conveyed in a straightforward, easily navigated way.
                                <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-1-84628-795-4_3.pdf">(2)</a> According to Balanced Website Design: Optimising Aesthetics, some guidelines for straight usability include keeping the site accurate and relevant, ensuring the site has an understandable layout, and making sure the site is clearly navigable.
                                <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-1-84628-795-4_3.pdf">(2)</a> Since the main function of Athena registration is registering for a schedule of classes, the current layout does not follow these guidelines, since the calendar tab is small and located near the bottom.

                            Students can input time and class preferences and Athena will automatically generate schedules: 
                            <br>
                            The University of North Carolina’s scheduling website is a perfect example of what we are trying to do with this lo-fi design. 
                            <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071581905001680?casa_token=CX-HV9NKxGMAAAAA:m7_oxtcED5P2v7kBIoj7GzV_rUPLHs63oUyD3SwkpWBv_b2UdNHZ6SyB8B8RiPicbGucX2vCJua6">(1)</a> The demonstration video on their website shows how you can select times that do not work during the week for class as well as all of the classes you would be open to taking. The website then automatically generates possible schedules that a student can look through. Our lo-fi design parallels this example to fulfill the user story by auto generating schedules to cut down on registration time. We chose to use tabs at the top for clarity and aesthetic reasons.

                            Suggesting certain class combinations based on advisors and other schedules:
                            <br>
                            A study has shown that a student’s perception of how well they believe an advisor is doing in providing quality academic help leads to higher success, based on GPA and continued enrollment.
                            <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/154541801.pdf">(12)</a> With this, students can quickly make higher quality schedules that fit their needs with the confidence that the information provided is both relevant and useful. Therefore, a way to view recommendations within the actual schedule building application would help streamline the process of integrating advisor’s help without having to switch back and forth between an email or degreeworks for example. We chose to include hovering to see the suggestions as a functionality because it declutters the page.<a href="https://mayvenstudios.com/blog/designing-hover-styles-and-the-future-of-the-technique">(6)</a>

Our lo-fi design parallels this example to fulfill the user story by auto generating schedules to cut down on registration time. We chose to use tabs at the top for clarity and aesthetic reasons.

                                <br>
                                With this design, we were hoping to enable students to access their advisor’s recommendations with more ease. Having this functionality would allow advisors to not only give students more direct assistance with class scheduling, but free up time during advisement to discuss other aspects of the student’s collegiate life. <a href="https://eds.s.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&sid=4d1670c7-8b23-42d7-af71-b00c8c3c1bea%40redis">(13)</a> Instead of having to consult a separate document or webpage, students can directly load the plan into Athena. This advisor plan would be accessible from the tab labeled “Plans”:

                                This design, which draws inspiration from CourseOff, features a drop down menu that gives a list of all the classes for a subject instead of having the user enter in the complete class name or CRN. This way, the student doesn’t have to keep track of all the different course numbers, and they can view all the different courses being offered for a subject.

                                Have a menu/side bar with starred classes:

                                The inspiration behind this idea was also from courseoff.com; however, this idea is more focused on the multi-select aspect when searching for classes in the sidebar. The reason for doing this is so that the user can look at all of the sections of a class and select multiple sections to see which sections overlap with their current schedule. This fulfills the user story because it enables a user to select multiple classes at once in order to see their schedule in full before they register for classes. 
                            </p>
                        </li>

                                Check to see if you have met the prereqs during the registration step:
                                <br>
                                For this wireframe, we used a hover design to show the information without cluttering up the page.
                                <a href="https://mayvenstudios.com/blog/designing-hover-styles-and-the-future-of-the-technique">(6)</a>
                                We also included alert banners in order to call attention to important information when the user tries to schedule a class that is not available for them. According to an article by Mike McCaffrey on alert banner best practices, “alert banners are often the best design pattern for presenting an urgent message or call to action to stakeholders who visit your website. A properly implemented alert banner can quickly and reliably catch the attention of your audience, let them know that an emergency is in progress, provide actionable instructions with the most relevant facts, and direct them to additional resources or updates as needed.”
                                <a href="https://www.kalamuna.com/blog/alert-banner-best-practices-web-design-disaster-part-1">(7)</a>
                                With our design, the student will be unable to add the class to their schedule if the student does not have the required prerequisite courses or the CRN they are trying to register for is full. Athena does warn the student about things like this to some degree, but only tells students that they cannot register for a class until after they have already tried to register. This means that if a student made a plan before their registration slot opened up, they wouldn’t find out that they couldn’t register for a certain class until the day of their registration. With our design, the student would be notified as soon as they tried to add a class to their list by a pop up notification which would be displayed prominently in the center.

                                Since Athena has multiple windows, adjusting them and keeping all of them in order can be challenging and overwhelming for the user, a condition known as featuritis. Featuritis occurs when a product is rendered unusable due to the overwhelming number of features.
                                (9) With this design, the user could have a menu that would enable them to select which menus they want to be displayed. Giving them more options with the display would grant them more control and allow for a more positive experience. According to the golden rules of interface design, as stated by Ben Shneiderman, “users strongly desire the sense that they are in charge of the interface and that the interface responds to their actions.” 
                                (10)Having the menu be a collapsible sidebar menu in the top right corner would allow the user to access the display options regardless of what page they’re on so they can adjust their display at any point.

                <h3>Justifcation for Changes:</h3>
                <li>
                    <p>We chose the idea “Students can input time and class preferences and Athena will automatically generate schedules” for our first user story because it involves Athena doing a lot of the work to generate scheduling options for students. Compared to the other low-level designs, this idea had an intuitive workflow and aligned the closest to other scheduling software we used as inspiration.
                        <a href ="https://registrar.unc.edu/guide/planning-for-registration/plan-your-class-schedule/">(4)</a> We changed “Class” to “Class search” because it more clearly conveys the functionality of the search bar. On the preferences tab, we added directions and a submit button for clarity purposes. On the preferences page, we changed the color of the blocked-off time to red because it typically has a connotation of stop or negate.
                        <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9623314">(14)</a>
                        The submit buttons were added to indicate a progression from one page to the other in a specific order. We made the tabs contrasting in color to indicate which one was selected. We added buttons underneath the plan options to view the schedule and to register for that plan. We initially didn’t have a concrete way to register for the selected classes.

                    <p>We chose to combine our two ideas for this user story. They were both similar to each other, and each one fulfilled an aspect of the user story that the other one did not. We changed from stars to checkboxes in the design because checkboxes display the state of being selected or deselected more clearly than a star. We added labels to indicate the times and days on the calendar. Labels were also added to indicate where you search. A “Register Selected Classes” button was added to the hi-fi design because in the initial design it was not clear how a student could actually register for the classes they selected. We added that the subject dropdown is sorted in alphabetical order and the class numbers are sorted by numerical order.</p>

                <li>
                    We chose “Check to see if you have met the prereqs during the registration step”, because this design gives the student a more clear idea of what classes are available to them (for instances where a section is full or a prerequisite is not fulfilled). We did not select the fully customizable registration page because we felt that it would be unnecessary. Also, our design for the idea we chose already brings the most relevant information to the main area of the website. For the hi-fi design, since we are not implementing functionality to the wireframes, we have the hover boxes appear as well as the general alerts. We decided to have information appear on hover to create a smoother user experience.
                    <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/154541801.pdf">(12)</a> With this, students can quickly make higher quality schedules that fit their needs with the confidence that the information provided is both relevant and useful. Therefore, a way to view recommendations within the actual schedule building application would help streamline the process of integrating advisor’s help without having to switch back and forth between an email or degreeworks for example. We chose to include hovering to see the suggestions as a functionality because it declutters the page.<a href="https://mayvenstudios.com/blog/designing-hover-styles-and-the-future-of-the-technique">(6)</a>
                    According to an article by Nate McGuire on hover styles, “Hover actions and tooltips also provide a valuable user experience. They allow users to get extra information without clicking away from where they are on the site.”

                    We also added labels for the days of the week and times of day. We filled in the class boxes on the calendar gray if there are no conflicts with the class and red if the student is unable to register for the class.
