        Athena is used by every UGA student for managing information related to their academic career from class scheduling to accessing their student accounts. The Athena interface has challenging UI/UX because it can hinder and even prevent students from registering for a working schedule.
Even after an advisor gives the available classes, it is difficult to plan a working schedule with the current Athena interface. While Athena does have the option to create plans, there is no way to view these plans on one screen, which makes it harder to decide which plan is the most optimal.This is not only unideal but also problematic as the confusion related around class planning can lead to students not signing up for the correct classes. Additionally, there is no way to view all the time slots for the necessary classes concurrently, which leads to students registering for classes that do not work with their other required classes. Sometimes a schedule could work except for one class that has a small overlap, which would cause you to have to start all over again. Trying to find all the sections that work with each other is a huge challenge, even with the planning feature, because students have no way to compare all the possible sections of different classes at once. Frequently students have to turn to third party software like CourseOff or Coursera to help them see all the classes that are open to them. 
Furthermore, Athena scheduling poses another problem because it does not list out classes that are only offered less regularly, which leads to students not registering for classes they need on time. Furthermore, Athena also does not show the location of the classes during registration, resulting in students registering for classes that are too far apart. All of these issues could cause students to not have the credits required to graduate, fatigue students with unideal schedules that could hinder their academic success, and have negative consequences on student health. 
In terms of examples of specific design failures, the Athena interface itself is confusing and hard to navigate. Some signifiers such as the buttons on the menu end up being anti-affordances because they do not communicate the affordances, such as pulling up the menu and viewing content as they should. For example, there are buttons on the table menu that are not clear what their functions are. This presents further problems because it is hard to use and confuses the user. Not only are the three windows on the scheduling page frustrating to position, it is also challenging to view the necessary course information on one page. 
Due to the anti-intuitive interface of Athena scheduling, students fall to confusion fatigue and move to other websites to ensure that their schedule can actually work or fail to register for the correct classes that they need. Our team wants to find a solution to improve this scheduling experience with the goal of making it more intuitive and efficient.
